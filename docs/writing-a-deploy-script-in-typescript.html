<main><h1>Writing a Deploy Script in TypeScript</h1>

<p>Published: Mon Sep 05 2022</p>

<!-- HTML_TAG_START --><hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: This is not a tutorial, I am a PHP Developer, and I haven&#39;t worked with TypeScript or Node very much at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-why">The Why</h2>
<p>Usually I use a small PHP CLI application I wrote called <code>ok</code> to deploy my projects, it doesn&#39;t do much other than perform a few sanity checks, then create a date based tag for the repo. Usually I have the build process in a GitHub action (or equivalent e.g. BitBucket Pipeline script), but <code>ok</code> will look for a <code>deploy.ok.php</code> file in the root of the project it&#39;s deploying and, if it exists, run that before tagging the repo - pretty useful you know. </p>
<p>For one reason or another I decided I&#39;d like this blog to be self-sufficient, maybe I&#39;ll decommission <code>ok</code> in the future, or maybe I&#39;ll want to work on my site somewhere I don&#39;t have access to my laptop with all my personal tooling already set up (disregard the fact I&#39;ll need to be cloning the repo and installing git for this - that comes with the static site hosted via GitHub pages territory). I&#39;m aware I&#39;ll still need node etc. but I&#39;d need that anyway to build the site locally (roll on moving the build step to GitHub actions).</p>
<h2 id="the-how">The How</h2>
<p>With TypeScript. Obviously.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/marccoup/blog/blob/main/deploy.ts" title="" target="_blank">Have a look</a></p>
<p>In all seriousness the most challenging part was running the file through a script defined in the <code>package.json</code> file. Since the script is written in TypeScript you can&#39;t do the usual <code>node my-script.ts</code> because node throws an absolute wobbly and refuses to run a TypeScript file (understandable, but I&#39;m still annoyed). </p>
<p>I soldiered on, trying <code>ts-node</code>, however this bad boy <strong>also</strong> likes to throw a wobbly because of the <code>.ts</code> extension (excuse me wtf?). Turned out to be something to do with the <code>&quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;</code> setting in my package.json - anyway the solution seemed to be <code>ts-node-esm</code>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll give you one guess as to what <code>ts-node-esm</code> did when trying to run this file? You guessed it - <em>threw an absolutely devastating wobbly</em> - just at a different point in the process, providing me with what one might call a &quot;false sense of hope&quot;. So, the hissy fit occurs when running the build via Vite&#39;s impressive <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-javascript.html" title="" target="_blank">JavaScript API</a> - for some bewildering reason, at the point my <code>vite.config.ts</code> file was being used for the build, <code>ts-node-esm</code> just couldn&#39;t find <code>@sveltejs/kit/vite</code> - I was lost. My google-fu lead me to a familiar issue - <code>&quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;</code> - at this point I understood, this little config option was destroying my deploy script&#39;s fledgling life, but I needed everything else to continue working exactly as it did before, so, I refused to change it.</p>
<p>At this point I thought that maybe trying to run the TypeScript directly was a lost cause, I&#39;d do what should be done with TypeScript and just compile it to JavaScript first. I try <code>tsc deploy.ts &amp;&amp; node deploy.js</code> and lo-and-behold yet another meltdown about the bloody <code>&quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;</code> config. I was close to giving up, but this time, I was given a useful tip by the error output - something to the effect of:  &quot;Rename the file to <code>deploy.cjs</code> to treat it as common js instead of this stupid module stuff you&#39;ve got going on and obviously don&#39;t understand&quot;. So, I did.</p>
<p>The final change to the project, making the <code>npm run deploy</code> command do <code>tsc deploy.ts &amp;&amp; mv deploy.js deploy.cjs &amp;&amp; node deploy.cjs</code> - probably terrible practice, probably will break, probably making any half-decent node-savvy developer cry. To be honest, haphazardly changing file extensions and expecting everything to work makes me uncomfortable, I don&#39;t feel like it should work, and I definitely don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a good idea - but it <em>did</em> work, and that makes it a good idea. So for now, up to until it breaks or I move the build to GitHub actions, this is how it shall remain.</p>
<h2 id="afterthoughts">Afterthoughts</h2>
<p>&quot;The Why&quot; section of this post is somewhat short, in hindsight that&#39;s because it really didn&#39;t make much sense to do this. I should have just done it in GitHub actions straight away. Oh well, it was a learning experience and that&#39;s what being a developer is all about - doing things the hard way for no good reason, reinventing the wheel, and then writing it off as a good thing because you <em>learned</em> something.</p>
<p>Have a good day!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy automating something you don&#39;t need to automate when you next get the chance.</p>
<p><small>p.s if this makes it to the blog, it was deployed with the script in question via <code>npm run deploy</code></small></p>
