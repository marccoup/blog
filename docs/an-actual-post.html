<h2>Yet another personal site/blog</h2>
<p>I build one so frequently it's essentially a habit. I write these &quot;a new site&quot; posts every time too. This is definitely the simplest one yet though, just markdown files used to generate posts. Hopefully it will go well!</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="/built-with.html">built with</a> page of the site to see what it's built with, or check out the <a href="https://github.com/marccoup/blog">repo</a> to see how it works. The README gives a decent explanation of that, alternatively, you can go source diving to figure it out (there's like 7 files to the whole thing). This is a static site so it's actually just generated via md files and then hosted via GitHub pages.</p>
<h3>What will I post here?</h3>
<p>Great question. Not sure of the answer</p>
<h3>Why did you build this site then?</h3>
<p>Bored, fancied building something, wanted to play with Svelte</p>
<h3>Is this an FAQ now?</h3>
<p>No, nobody has ever asked me these questions</p>
<h3>What next?</h3>
<p>I'm going to minify the css files, I don't like that GitHub has marked this repo as 50% CSS. Here's hoping that minifying them will rectify that</p>
